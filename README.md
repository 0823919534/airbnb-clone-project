# airbnb-clone-project

AirBnB Clone — learning project to reproduce core features of a short-term rental marketplace.
Goals: implement user auth, property listings (CRUD), search/filter, booking flow, and a responsive UI.

## Database Design

The project uses a relational database structure to manage users, property listings, and bookings.

**Entities:**
- **User:** stores user information such as name, email, and role (guest or host)
- **Listing:** represents a property listed by a host with fields like title, description, price, and location
- **Booking:** links a guest to a listing with start and end dates, total price, and status

**Relationships:**
- A user (host) can have many listings
- A listing can have many bookings
- A user (guest) can make many bookings

The database will be managed using Sequelize ORM with SQLite in development and PostgreSQL in production.

## Technology Stack

- **React / Vite / Next.js:** Frontend libraries/frameworks for building the user interface.
- **Node.js & Express:** Backend runtime and web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **Sequelize / ORM:** Object-Relational Mapper for interacting with the database.
- **SQLite / PostgreSQL:** Relational databases for development and production.
- **JWT / Passport.js / NextAuth:** Authentication mechanisms for secure login.
- **AWS S3:** Storage for listing images.
- **Jest / React Testing Library / Supertest:** Testing tools.
- **Docker / Docker Compose:** Containerization for consistent dev environments.
- **CI / CD (GitHub Actions, Vercel, Heroku, Railway):** Deployment automation.
- **Axios / Fetch:** Frontend HTTP clients.
- **bcrypt / jsonwebtoken:** Password hashing and token management.
- **ESLint / Prettier:** Code quality and formatting tools.

## Feature Breakdown

The AirBnB Clone project includes the following main features:

- **User Management:** Allows guests and hosts to create accounts, log in securely, and manage profiles. This feature supports authentication, authorization, and role-based access for different types of users.

- **Property Management:** Enables hosts to create, edit, and delete property listings, including details like title, description, price, and images. This feature ensures listings are well-organized and discoverable by guests.

- **Booking System:** Lets guests browse listings, select available dates, and book properties. It handles scheduling conflicts, calculates total price, and updates booking status, ensuring a smooth rental experience.

- **Search & Filtering:** Allows guests to search listings by location, price, and other criteria. This improves usability and helps users find properties that match their preferences.

- **Reviews & Ratings (optional):** Guests can leave reviews and ratings for listings they have stayed at. This helps maintain quality and trust within the platform.

- **Notifications (optional):** Sends alerts to users for booking confirmations, cancellations, and updates. This keeps users informed and engaged.

## API Security

The AirBnB Clone backend will implement several key security measures:

- **Authentication:** Users must log in securely using JWT tokens or OAuth methods. This ensures only verified users can access the system, protecting sensitive user data.

- **Authorization:** Role-based access control ensures guests and hosts can only perform actions they are allowed to. For example, a guest cannot modify a host’s listing. This prevents unauthorized actions and data breaches.

- **Rate Limiting:** Limits the number of requests a user or IP can make in a certain timeframe. This protects against abuse, brute-force attacks, and potential denial-of-service attacks.

- **Input Validation & Sanitization:** All API inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks, XSS, and other common vulnerabilities.

- **HTTPS & Data Encryption:** All communication will use HTTPS, and sensitive data like passwords will be hashed using bcrypt. This secures data in transit and at rest.

- **Logging & Monitoring:** Security events and suspicious activities will be logged and monitored. This helps detect breaches early and maintain accountability.

## CI/CD Pipeline

A CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) pipeline automates the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes. This ensures that new features and bug fixes are integrated smoothly, reducing human errors and speeding up delivery.

For the AirBnB Clone project, CI/CD helps to:
- Automatically run tests on every code commit to catch errors early.
- Build and deploy the frontend and backend consistently across environments.
- Maintain code quality and stability while allowing faster iteration.

Tools that could be used for CI/CD include:
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing, builds, and deployments triggered by Git pushes or pull requests.
- **Docker / Docker Compose:** Provides consistent containerized environments for development, testing, and production.
- **Vercel / Railway / Heroku:** Platforms for automated deployment of frontend and backend services.
